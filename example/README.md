# Embed React Native example application

[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Naereen/StrapDown.js.svg)](https://github.com/gr4vy/secure-fields/blob/main/LICENSE)

Simple React Native application demonstrating the usage of Embed.

## Usage

Before launching the example application, run `yarn` from the project's root to install all the required dependencies.

Make sure `GR4VY_ID` and `GR4VY_PRIVATE_KEY` are set in the `.env` file (you can copy `.env.example` and update accordingly). `GR4VY_PRIVATE_KEY` is the base64 representation of the private key you'll find in the Gr4vy Vault, used to create the Embed token. You can also pass a token directly by setting the `TOKEN` variable and it will be used everywhere instead of being generated by the node SDK. If you later change any of these variables, you have to reset Metro's cache by running `yarn start --reset-cache`, otherwise the old values would still be used.

Running `yarn ios` or `yarn android` from the package folder will start the app on either an iOS or Android simulator.
